# TTR-score-calculator
This repo keeps the source code of Web Score Calculator for Ticket to Ride (TTR) board game.

Every time we play to TTR  we need a fast score calculator. 
I've found many APP that do it but they need installation on smartphone and sometimes need registration.

I've created a small but complete score calculator that is accessible by web.
